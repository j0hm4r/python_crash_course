This repo contains the exercises and examples of the book.

## PART I: Basics

### Chapter 01: Getting Started

December 14, 2020

Nothing new here for me, but used the example to famaliarize myself with Geany.

### Chapter 02: Variables and Simple Data Types

December 15, 2020

I already knew most of it, except the use of underscores in long numbers and multiple assignment.

```python
# use of underscores in long numbers
long_number = 14_000_000_000
print(long_number)
*14000000000*

# multiple assignment
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

# convention for constants (python doens't have build in constant types)
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
```

To find the **Zen of Python**

```python
import this
```

Only used the REPL for some of the examples.
